## Description 

The purpose of this design is to implement a spiking neuron unit to identify digits of the MNIST data set. 

The neuron unit will take on the characteristics of a Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron model, which will have a membrane potential that will build (integrate) or decay (leak) according to the inputs. There will be threshold voltage value that when reached, will cause a spike in voltage (fire).

## Resources

This project was done as an outcome of an Iowa State Senior Design class. For further documantation on the impleentation visit the [project website](http://sdmay23-28.sd.ece.iastate.edu/).
